"""
Provides a simple command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the
Conversational Concierge agent.

This script initializes the agent and enters a loop to accept user input,
stream the agent's responses back to the console, and handle the exit command.
It serves as the primary entry point for running the application in a terminal.
