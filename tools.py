# tools.py
"""
Defines the collection of tools available to the conversational agent.

This module sets up the agent's capabilities, including:
1.  A retriever tool for searching the winery's knowledge base.
2.  A web search tool for general knowledge queries.
3.  A custom tool for fetching real-time weather information.

Proper error handling and logging are implemented for external API calls.
