# Golden Vine Winery - Napa Valley

## Our Story
Founded in 1985 by Isabella Rossi, a third-generation winemaker from Tuscany, Golden Vine Winery is a family-owned estate dedicated to merging Old World tradition with Napa Valley innovation. Isabella's vision was to create wines that express the unique character of our sun-drenched terroir. Our name comes from the way the California sun bathes the vines in a golden light just before harvest.

## The Winemaker: Julian Hayes
Our head winemaker, Julian Hayes, is a Napa Valley native with a degree in Viticulture and Enology from UC Davis. Julian believes in minimal intervention winemaking, allowing the quality of the grapes to be the star. He has been with us since 2010 and is the creative force behind our award-winning Cabernet Sauvignon.
